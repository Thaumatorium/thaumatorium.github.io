		</div>
		<p>It started in 2018 with creating a file containing all subreddit names from the site's sitemap (which has been made unavailable for unknown reasons) </p>
		<p>I downloaded all XML files and wrote a "throw-away-script" to pull out the important bits (the names) and throw the rest of the information away, which left me with a file of about a million subreddit names.</p>
		<p>I've had that file laying around for a while now, not really knowing what to do with it, but it's handy to keep data around every now and then!</p>
		<p>So, after a curious search for my own name, to see if there was a subreddit of people who share my name, my brain started churning: What if there are others?</p>
		<p>After digging around a bit I found several others: Kyle, Dan, Daniel, Dave, Michael, among others...</p>
		<p>But why not make a giant list of <strong>all</strong> the subreddits that relate to a name?</p>
		<p>To do this, I would need a giant list of first names and basically filter out all existing subreddits that did not exist in the names list, which would leave me list a list of subreddits that <em>did</em> exist in that list</p>
		<p>Good thing I had that file with all those subreddits laying around!</p>
		<p>Now, where to find a list of names? <em>Books</em>, of course!</p>
		<p>After a short search I found <a>Bruce Lansky's "100,000+ baby names"</a>, so I bought the Kindle version, converted it to text and got to work in my text editor to filter out most (if not all) names.</p>
		<p>After fiddling with regex for a bit, I got left with a list of 95477 names. Not really 100k, but close enough.</p>
		<p>While thinking about how to filter the subreddit list, I remembered that Excel had such a functionality! Quickly throwing those two lists in an Excel sheet and using <samp>Conditional Formatting</samp> on both lists to mark the names that were in both was a breeze, but to then <em>filter</em> those lists took quite a bit longer. This is mostly because Excel isn't made to filter lists of at least a 100k items!</p>
		<p>At first I tried to filter the subreddit list (which was about a million items long), but after two hours of waiting for the list to filter out all unmarked items, I force-quit Excel and tried to do the same on the names list instead. Success!</p>
		<p>I was left with a neat list of just a "measly" 8221 items it was time to turn to reddit to extract some information.</p>
		<p>Lucky for me, Reddit has public information on each subreddit! Even better: You can access such information by adding <samp>.json</samp> after each URL. Annoying, but understandable: information about a subreddit was somewhat hidden in <samp>/r/[SUBREDDIT]/about/.json</samp>, instead of the normal <samp>/r/[SUBREDDIT]/.json</samp>, but eh, it's not the worst. </p>
		<p>Now I was ready to extract the information I needed, but how? Well, this <em>is</em> the web, so it seems reasonable to use Javascript (even though I don't like the language for several reasons) for the task at hand, which I did.</p>
		<p>I turned the list of name-subreddits into a list of URLs, through arcane magic called <samp>regex</samp>, after which I threw the list into a <samp>.js</samp> file.</p>
		<pre><code>
				const urls = ["https://old.reddit.com/r/aakash/about/.json", 
				"https://old.reddit.com/r/aalia/about/.json", 
				"https://old.reddit.com/r/aarav/about/.json", 
				...
				"https://old.reddit.com/r/whittaker/about/.json", 
				"https://old.reddit.com/r/who/about/.json", 
				"https://old.reddit.com/r/whoopee/about/.json"]
		</code></pre>
		<p>And remember kids, Reddit has a rate limit of <strong>30 requests per minute!</strong> If you go over that, you'll be temporarily blocked!</p>
