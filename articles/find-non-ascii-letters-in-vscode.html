  <p>Paste that into your search (make sure to enable regex search) and it’ll show you any non-ASCII characters.</p>
  <p>Great for when your teacher gives you Haskell code that contains Unicode, yet packages like Brittany can’t handle
    them and crash when given said Unicode text…</p>
  <p>edit: So, after finishing my Minor (where I learned about Haskell and how parsing works – within Haskell) I finally
    understand regex!</p>
  <pre>
( ) = grouping
[ – ] = a list of choices
^ = not (this only counts if ^ exists between [ ]
\x00 = 0
\x7F = 127
</pre>
  <p>0-127 is the available range of ASCII characters (http://www.asciitable.com/), so since we want all NON-ASCII
  characters, we’re using the ^ operator, thus we get all unicode (excluding ASCII)</p>
