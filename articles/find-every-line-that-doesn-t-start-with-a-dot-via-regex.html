  <p><code>^((?!^\.).)*$</code></p>
  <p>I was trying to filter bootstrap.css from all non-classes, so I found this built this. It searches for all lines
    that don’t start with a dot.</p>
  <p>Great to use in combination with Notepad++ replace function (<kbd>Ctrl + H</kbd>)</p>
  <p><code>[:].*$</code></p>
  <p>To filter everything from a : till the end of the line.</p>
