			For context
		</h2>
		<p>I've been on reddit.com since 2008 (deleted my first account because I was going to "quit reddit" over some bullshit in 2012) and have seen this site <em>slowly</em> change over time and it's terrible.</p>
		<p>I am aware this sounds like a "ReDdIt SuCkS yOu GuIsE!" circlejerk, but <strong>I'm not just complaining: <em>I've found a fix.</em></strong></p>
		<h2 id=the-story>

			The story
		</h2>
		<p>At first (around 2008) I basically tried to absorb as many subreddits as I could as there was so much to learn from others. Over time, I had over 300 subs that I was following, but I tended to only visit a handful of subs, which meant that all the tiny subs I was following never showed up on my personalized frontpage, so I ended up culling 250 of them so I could better focus on the subs that <em>really</em> interested me. When I started school I had to cull even more subs because, as we all know, reddit is a huge time-waster, so I was left with a subreddit or 10, that I <em>really</em> liked. During this time I started using /r/popular as a SFW alternative to /r/all, because I didn't want to be the guy that was watching porn at school. Turns out you can filter up to 100 subreddits on /r/all, but /r/popular does not provide this functionality.</p>

			The fix
		</h2>
		<p>Cue <a href="https://redditenhancementsuite.com" title="also /r/Enhancement">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a>. It has had a filter option for <em>years</em>, but I never noticed it or when I did I though <em>"why would anyone filter anything?"</em> But now that I'm getting sick of reddit's bullshit this <strong>filter</strong> option is saving my mental health.</p>

		<h2 id=things-i-filter>

			Things I filter
		</h2>
		<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
		<p>I filter a sub if the sub is <em>targeting</em> bullshit that is going to cause bullshit drama, i.e. /r/politics having a shitfit over something inconsequential, because that <em>all</em> they do. If a sub does <em>not</em> target bullshit, but a user has posted bullshit (e.g. Ivanka Trump holding some object on /r/photoshopbattles) I just filter the user.</p>

		<h3 id="categories">Categories:</h3>
		<p><strong>political bullshit</strong>, usually the American variety, but that's only because the USA is a giant focal point of this site. Examples: ABoringDystopia, Bad_Cop_No_Donut, donaldtrump, InfowarriorRides, SelfAwarewolves, SandersForPresident, TopMindsOfReddit, LeopardsAteMyFace</p>
		<p><strong>LGBT</strong>. A person's sexuality is simply not interesting about a person. I don't hate you, I just think your subs are uninteresting. Examples: lgbt, me_irlgbt, lgballt, gay_irl, gaybros, bi_irl, bisexual</p>
		<p><strong>Sports</strong>. I just don't care about sports in general. Examples: nba, formula1, golf, baseball, reddevils</p>
		<p><strong>Other bullshit</strong>, subs that have a negative subject in general. Example: antiMLM, Chonkers, awfuleverything, cringe, gatekeeping, im14andthisisdeep, justneckbeardthings, NoahGetTheBoat, notliketheothergirls, peopleofwalmart, ProRevenge</p>
		<p>Note: This sadly only works on desktop, but since that's where I spend most of my Reddit days it works for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

			Closing words
		</h2>
		<p>I know that my categories can be construed as a fragile white redditor not being able to handle a widdle bit of USA powitics, but I've been confronted by this shit for more than a decade <strong>and nothing changes</strong>. Fuck, I've seen pictures of people basically making the same calls for improvement in the 1930s. <strong>The USA isn't going to change jack shit</strong>. Since nothing <strong>will</strong> be changed, why should I be continuously be confronted with it?</p>
		<p>Constantly being confronted with things <em>I can not change</em> (mostly because I'm Dutch, so I basically have 0 political power in the USA) will only fuck up my mind, and for what? Because of some subreddit that <em>may</em> shame my inaction (which I've blocked anyway, so I won't see it anyway)? Fuck no.</p>
		<p>PS: I'm aware that some people may use the subs I named to subscribe to them. More power to you! I unironically hope you'll enjoy those subreddits; I simply didn't.</p>
