			<h1>The Papers of E.F. &#34;The Coddfather&#34; Codd</h1>
			<p>Edgar Frank &ldquo;Ted&rdquo; Codd, also known as &ldquo;The Coddfather&rdquo;, or more generally as &ldquo;The Father of the Relational Model&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;ve gathered these papers here, as a) they were very hard to find, and b) there was no central place where all his Relational papers were gathered together. Some places had some papers, other places mentioned others. It was time this man got the respect he deserves and make his famous papers easier to find.</p>
			<p>While reading these, do keep in mind that they are <em>old</em>. For example: The first paper writes about using an <em>index</em> to select the needed domains/columns, a concept Codd changed his mind on around 1990 - Codd switched to using &ldquo;column names&rdquo; - as he found out some people were creating tables of 100s of columns wide, something not forseen by him when he invented the Relational Model, which would make it completely infeasable to using indices. Ain&rsquo;t no one going to refer to columns by their index number.</p>
			<p>Then also, in his 1988 &ldquo;Fatal Flaws in SQL&rdquo; articles, Codd writes about the lack of uniqueness in SQL. This has been mitigated (though not fixed) by the use of DISTINCT (introduced in SQL-86) and using PRIMARY KEYs (introduced in SQL-92). Little things like that make some of the papers a little outdated, even if they&rsquo;re still not wrong.</p>
