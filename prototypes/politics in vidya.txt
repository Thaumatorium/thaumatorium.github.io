"politics in video games" always meant "currently hot political topics in video games - games that don't revolve around current day politics", because it's annoying as fuck to be figuratively slapped out of your immersion because someone decided to slap a trans flag into a scene.
I like to use games as a way to escape reality and think about abstract ideas: Say you place your game in the far future (*cough* Cyberpunk 2077). How would your economic system work? Did your system use to be something like we have today, or did your world come from something else? Do you have new ideas that we as humanity may integrate into our existing systems? What are the pros? What are the cons?
What I don't want: "Black Lives Matter" and "orange man bad" rubbed in my face because creator doesn't like how the USA currently works. Give me a world that provides something new, something positive.
Are developers still free to stick BLM and trans flags in their games? They sure are!
And I'm free to bitch and moan about it, because I find it to ruin my experience. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

edit: Keep political propaganda out my games
