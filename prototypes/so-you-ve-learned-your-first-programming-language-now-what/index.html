		</div>
		<p>I believe there's a knowledge gap for beginners that know the basics (i.e. a single programming language), but don't know what to do after finishing something like "Head First Java"</p>
		<!-- insert Amazon affiliate links -->
		<p>I'll go over the things you (IMO) should learn to become a better programmer.</p>
		<p>It's <em>rougly</em> in order, but it's OK if you want to learn things differently. <strong>Always adapt someone else's ideas to fit your own situation.</strong> Never blindly adopt an idea.</p>
		<p>Note that this is my personal idea of how things should be, could be: It's fine to disagree</p>
		<h3>What you should already know</h3>
		<p>First I want to go over the things I expect you to know. If you don't: That's OK, because now you know <em>what</em> you don't know and you can take that into consideration.</p>
		<!-- list off things that an OOP beginner should know -->
		<ul>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>UML</h3>
		<p>It's one of those things you've probably seen, but you don't know a name for any of it, but if it's a diagram in a programming article, it's probably based on UML, the <strong>Unified Modeling Language</strong></p>
		<h3>Patterns and Frameworks</h3>
		<p>So you know how a <code>class</code> works, but how do you expand the patterns of a single class over multiple ones?</p>
		<p>Ever wondered how RTS' like Command and Conquer let you give a unit multiple commands for them to follow? There's a pattern for that</p>
		<p>Have you ever wondered how an undo/redo system from Notepad worked? There's a pattern for that.</p>
		<!-- insert Amazon affiliate links for CnC -->

		<p>Use "Head First Patterns" to learn yourself the basics and use "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" as documentation/quick lookup, once you get the hang of it.</p>
		<!-- insert Amazon affiliate links -->
		<p class="trivia">The authors of Design Patterns are referred to as the <strong>Gang of Four (GoF)</strong></p>
		<p>Protip: You can use use this to train yourself to learn UML</p>
		<p><strong>Do try to be careful:</strong> When I just learned about patterns, they were a hammer and everything else started to look like a nail. Do try not to fall into the same trap :)</p>
