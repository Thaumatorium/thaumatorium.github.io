  <h1>Welcome to the Thaumatorium!</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This website is pure uncompressed HTML/CSS/JS, with some PNG and WEBP images to fluff shit
    up. I like to think that this is how the web is <em>supposed</em> to be.</p>
  <p>
    An example on <em>how not to do HTML</em>, take a look at Twitter with their
    <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;divs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
    nonsense. Silly Twitter! That's not how HTML should look!

    any, please open a <a href="https://github.com/Thaumatorium/thaumatorium.github.io/issues">Github Issue</a>,
    whether it's just a spelling mistake or something wrong with the HTML.

    This site's author based in the Netherlands. I like to take an unnormal take on things: Look at what the masses are
    doing, learning from them by NOT doing that and finding out where the good shit is at!

    That doesn't necessarily mean that popular = bad. I mean C# is relatively popular yet is damn good! I (still) just hate JavaScript and its ecology. Feckin' JavaScript.
