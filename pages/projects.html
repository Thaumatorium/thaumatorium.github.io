    <h1>Thaumatorium.com</h1>
    <p>This site!</p>
    <p>First I was going to create it in Angular, but then I learned React and wanted it to it in that. But then I
      figured out how Elm worked and created the actual first version in that - on archive.org you can see the first
      version uses <code>elm.js</code>, but I found it to be too opinionated. Not to mention I found the
      <code>information/javascript</code> ratio to be too low.</p>
    <p>Eventually, after reading up on <a href=https://eloquentjavascript.net />JS</a>, <a
        href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev />HTML</a> and <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018 />CSS</a>, I decided
      to just write everything in pure web tech. And why not? I don't need a several kilobytes of javascript, just to
      show some articles!?</p>
    <p>And thus this site was born! I'm as of <time datetime=2020-05-09>2020-05-09</time> still busy writing and
      re-writing the site because I'm still building up experience, and I still have a small <a onclick=goto(this.hash)
        href=#todo>TODO</a> list and I'll have to finish, but it's fine.</p>
    <p>If you want to see what this site used to look like, check out <a

    <h1>Semantic Override Network (SON)</h1>
    <p>A news aggregator that will pierce the heavens!</p>
    <p>For real though: I'm still busy forming ideas around this project</p>
    <p>Every damn time I think "I got this", I usually lose it within a day or two, even after writing things down.</p>

    <h1><a onclick=goto(this.hash) href=#starfield>Starfield</a></h1>
    <p>It's the first type of project I've ever made! Well, other than "<code>hello world.c</code>"</p>
    <p>The first one I ever made was in cmd.exe, with some janky-ass <code>c</code> moving <code>*</code> and
      <code>.</code> characters as
      different sized stars from the right to the left.</p>
    <p>Over the years I created different versions (a 2D and even a 3D OpenGL variant!)</p>
    <p>Now that I know some HTML/CSS/JS, I decided to recreate this project for the web with plain HTML/CSS/JS! No crazy
      libraries needed!</p>
    <p>I still want to add brightness and color to the whole shebang!</p>

    <h1><a onclick=goto(this.hash) href=#mstg>Mocking Spongebob Text Generator (MSTG)</a></h1>
    <p>I created my own because others had randomized uppercase/lowercase and I wanted the odd letters to be uppercase and the even letters to be lowercase.</p>
