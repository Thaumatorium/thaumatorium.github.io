    <p>For real though: I'm still busy forming ideas around this project</p>

    <h1><a href="projects/starfield.html">Starfield</a></h1>
    <p>It's the first type of project I've ever made! Well, other than "<code>hello world.c</code>"</p>
    <p>The first one I ever made was in cmd.exe, with some janky-ass <code>c</code> moving <code>*</code> and
      <code>.</code> characters as
      different sized stars from the right to the left.</p>
    <p>Over the years I created different versions (a 2D and even a 3D OpenGL variant!)</p>
    <p>Now that I know some HTML/CSS/JS, I decided to recreate this project for the web with plain HTML/CSS/JS! No crazy libraries needed!</p>
    <p>I still want to add brightness and color to the whole shebang!</p>
