This file is UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark) - If you're using a decent editor, you can also see this in the status bar (at the bottom of the window) - 
This means that the meta tag with charset=utf8 isn't needed.
You could also set Content-Type in the packet header (that's something you should set in your server software)
You can use http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/ to see if your header encoding to UTF-8

			<h1>Welcome to the Thaumatorium!</h1>
			<p>
				This is my personal website, where I write my personal thoughts and post my little projects.
			<p>
				Note that this site is pure uncompressed HTML/CSS/JS, with some PNG and WEBP images to fluff
				shit up. I like to think that <strong>this is how the web is supposed to be</strong>, other than that these are
				static pages instead of built up by some (C#/JS/PHP/Java) framework.
			<p>
				If you want an example on <em>how not to do HTML</em>, take a look at Twitter with their
				<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;divs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
				nonsense. Silly Twitter! That's not how you should use HTML!
			<p>
				This site's author is based in the Netherlands. I like to take an unnormal take on things: Look at what the
				masses
				are doing, learn from them by NOT doing that and then find out where the good shit is at.
			<p>
				That doesn't necessarily mean that popular = bad. It means that most programmers don't *really* care about
				quality or speed - if not them, the company they work for.
